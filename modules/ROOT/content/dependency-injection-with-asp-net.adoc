[abstract]
Dependency Injection is a design pattern that makes coding easier.
It saves you the hassle of instantiating objects with complex dependencies, and it makes it easier for you to write tests.
With the https://github.com/couchbaselabs/Couchbase.Extensions/blob/master/docs/dependency-injection.md[Couchbase.Extensions.DependencyInjection library (GitHub)], you can use Couchbase clusters and buckets within the ASP.NET Core dependency injection framework.

In my last blog post on https://blog.couchbase.com/distributed-caching-aspnet-couchbase/[distributed caching with ASP.NET], I mentioned the DependencyInjection library.
Dependency injection will be explored in-depth in this post.
Feel free to follow along with the code samples I've created, available on https://github.com/couchbaselabs/blog-source-code/tree/master/Groves/078AspNetCoreDependencyInjection/src/CouchbaseDIExample[GitHub].

== Basic setup of Couchbase

First, you'll need a Couchbase Server cluster running.
You can:

* Install it xref:5.0@server:administration:install/install-intro.adoc[on-premise]
* Run in a container xref:5.0@server:getting-started:do-a-quick-install.adoc[with Docker]
* Use a cloud service like {url-azure}[Azure]

Next, you'll need to create a bucket in Couchbase.
This can be the "travel-sample" bucket that comes with Couchbase, or a bucket that you create yourself.

_If you are using Couchbase Server 5.0, you'll also need to create a user.
Give that user Cluster Admin permission, and give it the same name as the bucket, just to keep things simple if you are following along._

== Dependency Injection with Couchbase.Extensions

The https://github.com/couchbaselabs/Couchbase.Extensions[Couchbase.Extensions (GitHub)] project aims to make working with Couchbase Server and ASP.NET Core simpler.
Dependency Injection is just one of these extensions.

You can add it to your ASP.NET Core project with NuGet:

* By using Package Manager: `Install-Package Couchbase.Extensions.DependencyInjection -Version 1.0.2`
* With the NuGet UI
* Use the .NET command line: `dotnet add package Couchbase.Extensions.DependencyInjection --version 1.0.2`

_(Version 1.0.2 is the latest version at the time of writing)._

== More complex dependency injection

Until this point, we've only used dependency injection on Controllers.
Dependency injection starts to pay dividends with more complex, deeper object graphs.

As an example, imagine a service class that uses a Couchbase bucket, but also uses an email service.

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::{samplesdir}/ComplexService.cs[]
----

Next, let's use this service in a controller (aka making it a dependency).
But notice that the controller is not directly using either the bucket or the email service.

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::{samplesdir}/ApproveController.cs[]
----

If I were to instantiate `ComplexService` manually, I would have to instantiate at least two other objects.
It would look something like: `new ComplexService(new BucketProvider(), new MyEmailService()`.
That's a lot that I have to keep track of, and if any dependencies change, it's a lot of manual maintenance.

== Summary

Dependency injection is a rich subject.
Entire books have been written about it and its benefits to your application.
This blog post just scratched the surface and didn't even cover the testability benefits.

Couchbase.Extensions.DependencyInjection makes it easier to inject Couchbase into ASP.NET Core.
